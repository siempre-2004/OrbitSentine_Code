# Orbit Sentinel
A Unity 2D space-shooter prototype.

## 🎯 Overview
Orbit Sentinel is a fast-paced asteroid defense game that challenges players to maintain orbital stability while shooting down asteroids.  
The project emphasizes **clarity, responsiveness, and polish**—featuring real-time feedback systems such as camera shake, upgrade animations, and guided missile indicators.

## 🛠️ Features
- 🚀 Physics-based orbital movement  
- 🪨 Multiple asteroid types with different behaviors  
- 💥 Screen-shake and visual hit feedback  
- 🎯 Missile target indicators for improved aiming  
- 🔊 Custom-edited sound and music (Audacity + GarageBand)  
- ⚙️ Polished UI and particle systems

## 🔬 Technical Notes
- **Engine:** Unity (C#)  
- **Development time:** ~4 weeks  
- **Version control:** Git + Jira (1-week sprints)
